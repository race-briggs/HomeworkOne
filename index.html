          My name is Race Briggs, and I am a 24 year old college graduate from Trophy Club, Texas. I graduated from College in 2017 with a degree in government. After working for a few grassroots political organizations, I realized that I wanted to shift my career path to something more desirable, so I did some research and decided to pursue a career in Web Development.

          In my spare time, I enjoy science-fiction and fantasy novels, shows, and movies. I also enjoy video games, and have been an avid gamer since I was little. Some of my favorites movies are the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Ocean's Eleven, and Inglorious Basterds. My favorite shows are The Expanse, 30 Rock, and pretty much any other NBC sitcom. My favorite game is Dota 2, which I have been playing for over 10 years and have over 6000 hours of game time in, though I don't play as much anymore. I'm really hoping to change my life with this class, and if anyone wants to study just message me on Slack!
